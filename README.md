The main goal of this project is to provide a laboratory for those who are interested in learning about web security development in a practical manner.

## Build your own lab

By provisioning local environments via docker-compose, you will learn how the most critical web application security risks are exploited and how these vulnerable code can be fixed to mitigate them. üë©‚Äçüíª

## How do I start?

After forking this repository, you will find multiple intended vulnerable apps based on real life cenarios in various languages such as Golang, Python and PHP. A good start would be installing the ones you are most familiar with. üí°

Each of them has an `Attack Narrative` section that describes how an attacker would exploit the corresponding vulnerability.  Before reading any code, it may be a good idea following these steps so you can better understand the attack itself. üíâ

Now it's time to shield the application up! Imagine that this is your application and you need to fix these flaws! Your mission is writing new code that mitigates them and sending a new Pull Request to deploy a secure app! üîê

## How secure is my new code?

After mitigating a vulnerability, you can send a Pull Request using to gently ask secDevLabs community to review your new secure code. If you're feeling a bit lost, try having a look at [this mitigation solution](https://github.com/globocom/secDevLabs/pull/29), it might help! üöÄ
