## What is NoSQL Injection?

NoSQL Injection it's a vulnerability that occurs when codes / queries are injected on application's logic via unsanitized input.

You can find more about this vulnerability here: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_NoSQL_injection

## Setup

To execute this application, you need of 2 tools on your machine:
1. Docker
2. docker-compose

And to up the application, simply run these commands:

```sh

cd secDevLabs/owasp-top10-2017-apps/a1/mongection

```

```sh

make install

```

Then simply visit http://localhost:9995ðŸ˜†

## Get to know the app

The application simulate a simple Register/Login page. When you can register a account and when you do a successful login, you email will be showed on page.

Accessing the application (http://localhost:9995), the homepage have 2 buttons: 1 to do Login (http://localhost:9995/login.html) and 1 to Register a new account (http://localhost:9995/register.html).ðŸ˜œ

#### Homepage

#### Login Page
<p  align="center"><img  src="images/attack1.png"/></p>

#### Register Page
<p  align="center"><img  src="images/attack2.png"/></p>


When you create a account, you will see a message containing Hello and your email. This occurs too when you do a successful login.

#### Register Message

#### Login Message

## Attack Narrative

So, to exploit this application, you must to send a NoSQL query on email and password fields, such as: {"$ne":""}. This query tells to MongoDB that must return all results that are different of " " (null, empty).

You can do this via curl and only can be exploited with this tool, simply make a request containing the NoSQL query on email and passwords fields to login endpoint:

```sh
curl -X 'POST' 'http://localhost:9995/login' -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"email": {"$ne":""}, "password": {"$ne":""}}'
```

The application will return the first user that MongoDB find, and you'll see a message containing "Hello user".

#### Unsuccessful Login via curl

## PR Solutions

To fix this vulnerability it's necessary to sanitize all data that will be send to back-end, a way to do this is to convert all data to string or escape special chars.
