## <a name="definition"></a> What is ( vulnerability being explored in this app )?

A1 - SQL Injection

The main goal of this app is to discuss how **( SQL Injection (SQLi) )** vulnerabilities can be exploited and to encourage developers to send secDevLabs Pull Requests on how they would mitigate these flaws.

## Setup

To start this intentionally **insecure application**, you will need [Docker][Docker Install] and [Docker Compose][Docker Compose Install]. After forking [secDevLabs](https://github.com/globocom/secDevLabs), you must type the following commands to start:

```sh
cd secDevLabs/owasp-top10-2017-apps/a1/phpi
```

```sh
make install
```

Then simply visit [localhost:10001][App], as exemplified below:

## Get to know the app ( Cool emoji describing the app - Get creative! üòù )

This is a simple login app. You could create an account and test a login system.

To properly understand how this application works, you can follow these simple steps:

- Register a new user via front-end.
- Login as this user via front-end.

## Attack narrative

Now that you know the purpose of this app, what could possibly go wrong? The following section describes how an attacker could identify and eventually find sensitive information about the app or it's users. We encourage you to follow these steps and try to reproduce them on your own to better understand the attack vector! üòú

### üëÄ

#### ( Brief description of what was exploited/is vulnerable )

This first part, üëÄ , is dedicated to describing all the steps needed to identify the vulnerability installed on your app so that anyone following this guide is able to replicate it.

Usually, some nice steps to include are:
* What's the app main page?
* How can you access it?
* How did you discover the vulnerability?
* If you used the command line, be sure to include the command used! You can include the command by doing this:

```sh
    ```sh
    $ My awesome command here

    ```
```

A nice example of images to have on an attack narrative in the discovery section is:

First time acessing the app:

</p>

Confirmed the suspicion by having a look at the code!

</p>

Add as many images as you can! A picture is worth more than a thousand words!

### üî•

This second part, üî• , is dedicated to describing all the steps needed to exploit the vulnerability found previously.

In this section, your goal should be on how to exploit the app and it's steps. A good guideline to follow is:
* Include all the steps to reproduce the exploit.
* If you used the command line, be sure to add the command here!
* It would be great if you added references to your narrative, such as used tools, exploits (preferably from [ExploitDB]) , a RFC, or any other text.

And as always, images!!! üòÉ

Some good examples of images are as follows:
