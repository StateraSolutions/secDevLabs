## What is Broken Authentication?

Definition from [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/images/7/72/OWASP_Top_10-2017_%28en%29.pdf.pdf):

Application functions related to authentication and session management are often implemented
incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit
other implementation flaws to assume other users‚Äô identities temporarily or permanently.
