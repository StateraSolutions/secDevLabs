# Attack Narrative - Snake Pro

The main goal of this documentation is to describe how a malicious user could exploit a Sensitive Data Exposure vulnerability intentionally installed on Snake Pro from secDevLabs.

If you don't know [secDevLabs](https://github.com/globocom/secDevLabs) or [this intended vulnerable web application](https://github.com/globocom/secDevLabs/tree/master/owasp-top10-2017-apps/a3/snake-pro) yet, you should check them before reading this narrative.

After reviewing how application stores users' passwords in MongoDB, it was possibile to see that sensitive data is being stored in clear text, as can be seen in `Register()` (routes.go) function and in `UserData` (types.go) struct:

</p>

Additionally, the channel is being used by users to send their sensitive data is unsafe (HTTP), as shown bellow:

If database is somehow exposed, all users' passwords  will be leaked, as shown on these MongoDB documents. To view them, you can locally install [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/download) and use default credentials used in `docker-compose.yml`:

```
Database: snake_pro
User name: u_snake_pro
Password: svGX8SViufvYYNu6m3Kv
```

</p>

Also, as login pages uses HTTP to transmit users' credentials, an attacker on the same network as the victim (same wifi, for example) can use `tcpdump` to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.

To install tcpdump on Mac, use the following command:

```sh
brew install tcpdump
```

To start sniffing grepgin for passwords from SnakePro, an attacker can use the following command:

```sh
sudo tcpdump -i lo0 -X host localhost | grep -C 2 pass --color
```
