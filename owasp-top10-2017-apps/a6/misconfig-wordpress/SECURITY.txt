Updating to the latest version is going to prevent which your application is vulnerable to the known Wordpress vulnerabilities. You can update it in Admin Dashboard clicking in `Please update now`.

2. Error message

Change the retorned error message in lines 152 and 175 in wp-includes/user.php file to a generic message like "The username or password you entered is incorrect.".

3. Default password

Change the admin's default password to a strong one. The Wordpress has a function which generate a randomic and strong password in Admin Dashboard:

The .htaccess file is used to configure additional features for websites hosted on Apache Web Server. This file is in the root folder of your project, in our case it is in the /var/www/html.

Add in .htaccess file this lines:

#-------------------------------------------------------#
# BEGIN HttpHeaders
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
  Header always set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
  <FilesMatch "\.(php|html)$">
    Header always unset X-Powered-By
    Header unset X-Powered-By
    Header set X-Frame-Options "DENY"
    Header set X-XSS-Protection "1"
  </FilesMatch>
</IfModule>
# END HttpHeaders

# BEGIN HttpHeadersCookieSecurity
php_flag session.cookie_httponly on
# END HttpHeadersCookieSecurity
#-------------------------------------------------------#

In both cases you need to execute the commands below to enable this changes:
