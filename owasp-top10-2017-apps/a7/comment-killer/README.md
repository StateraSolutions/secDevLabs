# Comment-killer

Comment-killer is a simple JS app that contains an example of multiple Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities and its main goal is to describe how a malicious user could exploit them on this purposefully vulnerable app.

## What is Cross-Site Scripting?

XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user-supplied data using a browser API that can create HTML or JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victimâ€™s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.

The main goal of this app is to discuss how **Cross-Site Scripting** vulnerabilities can be exploited and to encourage developers to send secDevLabs Pull Requests on how they would mitigate these flaws. Learn more <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">here</a>.

## Setup

To start this intentionally **insecure application**, you will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). After forking [secDevLabs](https://github.com/globocom/secDevLabs), you must type the following commands to start:

`sh cd secDevLabs/owasp-top10-2017-apps/a7/comment-killer `

`sh make install `

Then simply visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) ! ðŸ˜†

## Get to know the app ðŸ‘¾

To properly understand how this application works, you can follow these simple steps:

-   Read all blog posts.
-   Comment in a post.

If you want to reset the app then reload the page.

## Attack narrative

So now you have the app up and running - congrats! This section will show how a hackers can use XSS and attack anybody who visits this webpage.

## Secure this app

How would you mitigate this vulnerability? After your changes, an attacker should not be able to:

-   Execute scripts through input fields
